What did I learn? 
I learned about core appsetting.json file.
I learned how to access configuration information using "IConfiguration Services".

created constructor of Startup class and used Iconfiguration to fetch "MyKey" from appsetting.json file, appsetting.Development.json filw and launchsettings.json file
the appsettings.Development.json file will override appsettings.json file and launchsettings.json file will override both of the files.
The config information written on CLI was overdone by every config info written in files and env variable.
  
What was challenging, if anything?  
Different Web hosting servers has different working and as beginner it is new topic for me.
   
How did I resolve the challenges or problems when they appeared?  
no error occured
