What did I learn? 
I just Got one thing that when user enteer in any of the data that is visible to him the id of that person is still viewable and we want to encrypt that so we do all the things and I didn't get it. 
 
What was challenging, if anything?  
As a part of the course, I have completed these 7 videos but To be honest I didn't understand a word beacause every concept was related to its previous video and I didn';t watch it.

How did I resolve the challenges or problems when they appeared?  
I just copy pasted it from the youtube video and didn't understand a word.
